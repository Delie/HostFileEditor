# HostFileEditor
Very basic Windows hosts file editor for syncronising hosts file settings between machines.  

Note: requires a cloud storage client app running on each machine.  e.g Google Drive, OneDrive, DropBox, etc

Handy if you're a web developer with multiple machines  e.g. desktop, laptop, work pc, etc
